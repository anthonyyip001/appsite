							<h1 class="major">A Generic Page</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This app started off as a simple idea I had during my first trip to Japan and as I worked on it, I continuously thought of new features to make it a better trip map. Creating and managing this app solo took a lot of time, learning, and some freelancer mentoring despite it seeming simple, but marketing and creating a perfect suggestions map for trips will be harder because it requires not only influencers but also a good community to help create a map with great recommendations.</p>

							<p>Current Goal: Get a sum of influencers/partners willing to be featured on feature page. Ideally 1 from each country(Japan, Spain, France, Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, India, Hong Kong) for each category(Instagram, Youtube, Facebook, Tour Company). Since I organized points to be Country -> Cities(can be any name), clicking on a city then loads a map with all the points in that city collection, and points having influencer's icon(showin in during trip) if they added a point from their collection. there is also main IAP decision between everyone having access to all points and supporting allows vote or every icon locked and in app purchase gives access to support and unlock one icon.</p>

							<p>So my app is a free travel app for tourists/travelers that look for places, restaurants, or inspiration for their next trip on Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, or google after they purchased their airplane ticket. Then when they see an interesting place, they search for the place on the app and add it to a collection that then maps all the points in that folder when opened with notes if desired. Then when they are at their trip location, they can then open their labeled collections and get a visual map view of their points in each collection. (Shown in during trip)</p>

							<p>The in app purchase part of the app is where I plan to remove ads and give the user a choice to support one icon in the featured page which has a mix of icons of Instagram travel influencers, tour companies, youtubers, facebook travel groups, and other travel related people that I will call 'partners'(can't think of other names). And assuming the user came from you or is a free user looking to access one of many partner's points, they would then click to unlock your icon, then the app will take note and the user now has access to your collection of points with each point also having short notes. Then they add interesting points they see to their own folder, and when they open their own folder, your icon is also displayed on their map(Shown in during trip). Or if that seems too stingy, all users would have access to all points and iap gives ability to give a choice to support one partner for incentives like their top ten food places to visit list </p>

							<p>This app may be taking the shape of a "support your favorite influencer/partner app and get their convenient travel guide on a simple, easy to use point of interest map app on your phone" that potentially targets a more digital audience but because I intended for this app to be simple, also usable by non tech-savvy people. I will also display a 'supporter' count on the featured page so that will also increase by 1 everytime someone supports. I have not yet, but plan on creating a featured page and a map for countries with the highest tourism stats that will then contain and display the points from the country's 3-5 most supported partner's list of top 10 food and/or top 10 non-food places to visit in that country that I believe will have more readability than a site like tripadvisor, because the map will theoretically only contain top 10 points of "the most supported" partners(shown in shape social side). The featured page for each country will also eventually only contain people that have visited that country but that is at least 6 months away, whereas for my app launch, the main featured page I have now and for at least the next 6 months will only contain partners with different countries for each category(ie: the 4 icons under tour companies in featured page will have one tour company for Japan, Europe, Korea, India) so I was wondering if you would like to fill the ______ spot for my app launch. Depending on reception of this app, I also planned on changing the featured page every 4 to 6 months but as this is the first page i am trying to fill and I still have lots of features to add, the first group I find to fill the page will probably be the group that stays on the main featured page the longest, as well as the highest % commission.</p>

							<p>Because I am still a college student, I do not have much to offer except for traffic I may get when I start marketing the free part of my app, other non-referred users that may be interested in discovering more interesting places, and  possibly increased brand awareness from people seeing icon on page and being on map. I also do not have a price set for supporting a featured partner yet but plan on setting it at 1.99-9.99 with the upper end probably including a lot more incentives to pay more with there also being possibility of partners setting their own unique price and incentives. I definitely do not want to have people purchase the mobile guide over your actual tour but I feel like my audience would be the type that does not necessarily look for tours but want to create their own ideal trip, or at least visit interesting places they saw on Facebook before they actually go. I can also modify my app to solely fit your usage to distribute within a group so people can look at the app filled with extra points that they can access when they have time to wander. </p>


							<p>Picture of Japan map on previous page is example of top 3 supported influencers in a country having their icon and markers of their top 10 restauraunts or non restauraunts on the country recommendation map.</p>

							<p>After releasing, I will judge whether or not I should continue updating this app or move onto my next idea based on stats, but this app provided a great learning experience and an app I can use for future trips. Thanks for reading!</p>
