							<p>This app started off as a simple idea I had during my first trip to Japan and as I worked on it, I continuously thought of new features to make it a better trip map. Creating and managing this app solo took a lot of time, learning, and some freelancer mentoring despite it seeming simple, but marketing and creating a perfect suggestions map for trips will be harder because it requires not only influencers but also a good community to help create a map with great recommendations.

The in app purchase part of the app is where I plan to remove ads and give the user a choice to support one icon in the featured page which has a mix of icons of Instagram travel influencers, tour companies, youtubers, facebook travel groups, and other travel related people that I will call 'partners'(can't think of other names). And assuming the user came from you or is a free user looking to access one of many partner's points, they would then click to unlock an icon, then the app will take note and the user now has access to a collection of points with each point also having short tips. Then they add interesting points they see to their own folder, and when they open their own folder, your icon is also displayed on their map(Shown in during trip). Or if that seems too stingy, all users would have access to all points and iap gives ability to give a choice to support one partner for incentives like their top ten food places to visit list

I have not yet, but plan on creating a featured page and a map for countries with the highest tourism stats that will then contain and display the points from the country's 3-5 most supported partner's list of top 10 food and/or top 10 non-food places to visit in that country that I believe will have more readability than a site like tripadvisor, because the map will theoretically only contain top 10 points of "the most supported" partners(shown in shape social side). The featured page for each country will also eventually only contain people that have visited that country but that is at least 6 months away, whereas for my app launch, the main featured page I have now and for at least the next 6 months will only contain partners with different countries for each category(ie: the 4 icons under tour companies in featured page will have one tour company for Japan, Europe, Korea, India). Depending on reception of this app, I also planned on changing the featured page every 4 to 6 months but as this is the first page i am trying to fill and I still have lots of features to add, the first group I find to fill the page will probably be the group that stays on the main featured page the longest, as well as the highest % commission.

Picture of Japan map on previous page is example of top 3 supported influencers in a country having their icon and markers of their top 10 restauraunts or non restauraunts on the country recommendation map.

After releasing, I will judge whether or not I should continue updating this app or move onto my next idea based on stats, but this app provided a great learning experience and an app I can use for future trips. Thanks for reading!</p>
